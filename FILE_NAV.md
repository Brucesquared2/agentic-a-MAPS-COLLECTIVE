✅ Outcome
Paste these five files into VS Code (CONFIG_PANEL.md, REPOS.md, HOOK_LOG.md, ALGO_COMPILER.md, FILE_NAV.md).

They reflect directly into your pipeline as narratable manifests.

Dropdowns, prompt boxes, and YAML blocks give you structured + human context.

File Navigator ensures prior algos are reusable.

Together, the packet makes your cockpit modular, reproducible, and audit‑ready.
